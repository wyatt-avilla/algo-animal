  "description": "Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.\n\nA subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., \"ace\" is a subsequence of \"abcde\" while \"aec\" is not).\n",
